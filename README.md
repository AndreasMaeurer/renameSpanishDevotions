# "rename Spanish Devotions" Python Script

This directory contains:
* A subdirectory with sample files to be renamed.
* A very simple Python script.

## Scope:
The Problem is that files are sent to us once a month from Colombia using their naming convention.  We need to rename these files into our naming convention.
Renaming ~30 files one by one is time consuming.  A more elegant solution is implemented in this script which renames all files at once.

## Usage:
python3 fixMedNames.py

## Notes:
This script is written in python3.  (version 3 as opposed to 2.X)
The script can be made executable by: chmod 777 fixMedNames.py or a similar chmod command, depending on what permissions are to be granted.
